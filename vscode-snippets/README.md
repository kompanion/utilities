# User Snippets for VS Code

**Note:** To use this, you need [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

These snippets will speed up your work by allowing complex code structures to be built at a few keystrokes. After setting them up, you'll write the prefix for the snippet and then press `TAB` (by default) to expand the code.

The set-up is simple: open the menu "Configure User Snippets" under "Preferences" (you can do so by typing `CTRL + SHIFT + P` and typing "snippet" in the search box), choose the language you want to change and then copy and paste the snippets you want.
